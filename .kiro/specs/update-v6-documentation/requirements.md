# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Based on comprehensive code analysis, the Estia AI memory system has successfully evolved to v6.0 with all previously identified issues resolved. The fusion architecture combines the complete 14-step workflow from the legacy system with the elegant manager-based architecture of the new system. All core functionalities including asynchronous evaluation, session management, memory layering, and user profiling have been fully implemented and tested with excellent performance metrics (671 QPS, 1.49ms response time, 588x cache acceleration).

The current documentation still references v5 and lists several issues as unresolved, which no longer reflects the actual system state. This update is needed to accurately represent the current capabilities and status of the v6.0 fusion architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Update Version References

**User Story:** As a developer or user reading the documentation, I want to see accurate version information that reflects the current system capabilities, so that I understand what features are available and what the system's current status is.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing project documentation THEN all version references SHALL be updated from v5 to v6
2. WHEN reading the fusion architecture implementation plan THEN the document SHALL reflect v6.0 as the current production-ready version
3. WHEN checking README.md THEN the version evolution section SHALL show v6.0 as the latest stable release
4. WHEN examining performance metrics THEN they SHALL reflect the actual v6.0 benchmarks (671 QPS, 1.49ms response time)

### Requirement 2: Update Problem Status

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to see the current status of previously identified issues, so that I can understand what has been resolved and what the system's current capabilities are.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the fusion architecture implementation plan THEN all previously identified problems SHALL be marked as resolved
2. WHEN checking the "发现的问题" section THEN each item SHALL show ✅ status with "(v6.0已解决)" notation
3. WHEN reading problem descriptions THEN they SHALL include brief explanations of how each issue was resolved
4. WHEN examining the implementation status THEN it SHALL reflect that all core features are fully implemented

### Requirement 3: Update Feature Implementation Status

**User Story:** As a developer working with the system, I want to know which features are implemented and available, so that I can properly utilize the system's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing feature lists THEN all implemented features SHALL be marked with ✅ status
2. WHEN checking the 15-step workflow documentation THEN it SHALL reflect full implementation status
3. WHEN examining the six-manager architecture THEN each manager SHALL be documented as fully operational
4. WHEN reading about advanced features THEN they SHALL be marked as available and production-ready

### Requirement 4: Update Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a system administrator or performance analyst, I want to see current and accurate performance metrics, so that I can understand the system's capabilities and plan for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing performance sections THEN metrics SHALL reflect actual v6.0 benchmarks
2. WHEN checking QPS ratings THEN they SHALL show 671.60 QPS as achieved performance
3. WHEN examining response times THEN they SHALL show 1.49ms average response time
4. WHEN reviewing cache performance THEN they SHALL show 100% hit rate and 588x acceleration
5. WHEN checking system initialization time THEN it SHALL show 7.1s actual performance

### Requirement 5: Update Architecture Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer or architect, I want to understand the current system architecture, so that I can effectively work with or extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing architecture diagrams THEN they SHALL reflect the v6.0 fusion architecture
2. WHEN checking component descriptions THEN they SHALL accurately describe implemented functionality
3. WHEN examining manager responsibilities THEN they SHALL reflect actual implementation status
4. WHEN reading about system capabilities THEN they SHALL match the current v6.0 feature set

### Requirement 6: Update Implementation Roadmap

**User Story:** As a project manager or developer, I want to see the current implementation status and future plans, so that I can understand what's complete and what's planned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing implementation phases THEN completed phases SHALL be marked as ✅ complete
2. WHEN checking the roadmap THEN it SHALL reflect v6.0 as the current stable version
3. WHEN examining future plans THEN they SHALL build upon the v6.0 foundation
4. WHEN reading about migration status THEN it SHALL reflect successful completion to v6.0

### Requirement 7: Language Consistency

**User Story:** As a Chinese-speaking user or developer, I want all responses and documentation updates to be in Simplified Chinese, so that I can better understand and work with the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving responses from the AI assistant THEN all responses SHALL be in Simplified Chinese
2. WHEN updating documentation THEN Chinese sections SHALL remain in Chinese
3. WHEN adding new content THEN it SHALL follow the existing language pattern of each document
4. WHEN communicating about tasks THEN all communication SHALL be in Simplified Chinese
